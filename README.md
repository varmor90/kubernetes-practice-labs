# Kubernetes Practice Labs ☸️

This repository contains my personal practice labs based on  
🎓 *Docker & Kubernetes: The Practical Guide (2025 Edition)* by Academind.

I'm using this repo to reinforce key Kubernetes concepts through hands-on examples.

## 📁 Folder Structure
├── kubernetes-core-concepts/ # Pods, Deployments, Services
├── kubernetes-networking/ # Multi-container Pods, DNS, communication
└── kubernetes-managing-data-and-volumes/ # Volumes, PV, PVC, emptyDir, hostPath


Each folder contains YAML manifests, commands, and mini-examples related to the topic.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These labs are heavily inspired by the course examples and are meant for educational purposes.  
Over time, I will add my own customizations and experiments.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Docker, Docker Compose
